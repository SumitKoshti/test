Python is a dynamically-typed programming langauge.
It's a high-level, general purpose language.
It's developed by Guido van Rossum in the late 80s
Just like the other programming language Ruby, Python was designed to be easily read by programmers. 
Because of its large following and many libraries, Python can be implemented and used to do anything from webpages to scientific research.
